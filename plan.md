# CDBVS implementation plan

## Status

The first working editor baseline is in place. The repository now contains a desktop VS Code extension with a custom `.cdb` editor, a spreadsheet-style webview, schema-aware primitive/reference controls, row/column/sheet editing, quick search, per-column filtering and sorting, and a raw JSON fallback. The reusable CastleDB Haxe `cdb` sources from `Cursemark\.haxelib\castle\git` are vendored under `vendor/castledb/cdb`, while the legacy level-editor sources are intentionally excluded.

## Completed

- Created the VS Code extension manifest and `.cdb` language registration.
- Added a `CustomTextEditorProvider` named `cdb.editor` for desktop VS Code.
- Added commands to open, validate, and format `.cdb` documents.
- Added a `.vscode/launch.json` configuration for starting an Extension Development Host with `F5`.
- Ported the CastleDB type-string conventions and basic validation into `src/cdbParser.js`, based on the original `cdb/Parser.hx` and `cdb/Data.hx` sources.
- Added a spreadsheet webview with visible-sheet tabs, search/filtering, schema-aware booleans/enums/references/numbers, generic JSON-backed complex values, and automatic workspace edits.
- Added raw JSON editing for recovery and for CastleDB constructs not yet represented by a specialized control.
- Added the `cdbvs.showHiddenSheets` setting for optionally exposing CastleDB internal/sub-sheets.
- Added expandable, schema-driven list cells using CastleDB's `parentSheet@listColumn` sub-sheet definitions, including nested lists, add/delete list items, and primitive/reference editors inside list rows.
- List cells now show only the first item's truncated field preview with compact expand/collapse arrows; nested values are summarized as `[...]`, toggling updates only that cell, and document refreshes restore the table's horizontal/vertical scroll position.
- Text (`TString`) fields open a larger multiline modal editor on double-click, with Save/Cancel controls and Ctrl/Cmd+Enter save support.
- Column headers now include a pencil editor for names, type strings, optional/display/kind/scope/documentation settings, advanced JSON properties, and deletion.
- Sheet tabs now include a pencil editor for sheet metadata and advanced properties, with in-modal deletion of a sheet and its sub-sheets; sheet renames update sub-sheet names and direct reference type strings.
- Added row insertion/deletion from the sheet controls, with row ordering handled as a sheet-level non-destructive sort view rather than per-row controls. Separator metadata remains preserved by the model for raw/data edits.
- Replaced row-level delete `x` controls with row-number selection, whole-row highlighting, Insert/Delete Row toolbar actions, and matching selection controls for expanded list items.
- Added column and sheet move-left/move-right actions in their edit modals.
- Added schema-driven `TProperties` expansion, a JSON custom-type editor with reference validation, checkbox-based `TFlags`, and a color picker for `TColor`.
- Added quick row search plus a type-aware filter/sort modal covering every column, with non-destructive sorting and a clear-all view reset.
- Refactored the webview from one large script into focused runtime, DOM, model, actions, cell, modal, view, and bootstrap modules loaded in dependency order.
- Moved the sheet tabs into a sticky bottom dock while keeping the active sheet's search/filter/sort bar at the top.
- Fixed the modular filter modal Apply path and added a visible summary of the active sheet search, filters, and sorting beneath the view controls.
- Aligned the sheet search box with the view buttons and added an embedded X button that clears only the search query.
- Replaced the global view reset with individually removable search, filter, and sort pills; removed the confusing per-row insert/separator icons.
- Separated filtering and sorting controls: the toolbar now opens a filter-only modal, while each column header cycles neutral/descending/ascending sorting with a compact icon.
- Simplified main and nested headers to show only their intended controls and names, removing inline type/optional metadata.
- Restored visible separator section rows in the table, using separator object titles or `props.separatorTitles` when available.
- Kept separator titles sticky at the left edge so section names remain visible during horizontal table scrolling.
- Strengthened active-state styling for selected sheets, active modes, applied view pills, sorting, search, and expanded nested cells.
- Changed the main table to content-based auto sizing so columns shrink to their titles/data where possible instead of expanding evenly.
- Balanced the compact sizing so text fields have usable minimum widths and editable controls fill their columns while numeric/list/nested cells remain narrow.
- Added explicit primary-ID controls to column and sheet editors, enforcing CastleDB's single `typeStr: "0"` ID column.
- Pinned each sheet's primary-ID column beside the row numbers with a sticky scrolling boundary, keeping it visible during horizontal table scrolling.
- Fixed column move-left, move-right, and delete actions to redraw immediately after their structural document updates.
- Replaced the column type-string text control with a named type dropdown and contextual type-argument/raw fallback fields while preserving CastleDB type-string serialization.
- Copied the reusable `cdb` Haxe model/parser sources and original license/readme into `vendor/castledb`.
- Added `test/fixtures/sample.cdb` from the original repository for manual editor smoke testing.
- Saved project scope, reuse guidance, and validation expectations in `agents.md`.

## Next steps / unfinished pieces

These are intentionally still open for the next milestone:

1. Add automated tests for parsing, type-string handling, defaults, duplicate IDs, formatting, and webview update serialization.
2. Improve schema editing with a dedicated type picker, required/optional conversion rules, and safer type conversions when a column's type changes.
3. Add richer controls for remaining CastleDB values: tile positions, gradients, curves, dynamic values, and file/image pickers.
4. Add reference validation and useful navigation from a reference cell to the target sheet/row.
5. Match CastleDB separator/group behavior from the Haxe model, including separator titles, group materialization, and preserving separator metadata safely.
6. Add VS Code integration tests and package the extension as a `.vsix` once the local Node/npm or VS Code extension test tooling is available.
7. Consider compiling or generating a shared JavaScript CastleDB core from the vendored Haxe model if the direct JavaScript port begins to diverge from CastleDB compatibility.
8. Evaluate the legacy localization export and image-cleanup utilities for VS Code commands; the legacy open/recent/save-as/exit menus are intentionally replaced by VS Code's document and workspace lifecycle.

## Verification notes

- The environment has Haxe available, but no project dependencies or Node/npm executable were available during the initial pass, so a full extension host launch and `.vsix` packaging check remain outstanding.
- `package.json`, `language-configuration.json`, and the sample `.cdb` fixture all pass the available PowerShell JSON parse check. The vendored `cdb` sources match the source repository by SHA-256, and no level-editor files were copied.
- The sample fixture contains three list columns with matching sub-sheet schemas, including the nested `monsters@skills@sub` list schema used to verify recursive expansion paths.
- The search/filter/sort pass passed PowerShell JSON and feature-presence checks. A full JavaScript syntax check and extension-host smoke test remain unavailable because Node/npm are not installed in this environment.
- The refactor passed PowerShell module-existence, script-load-order, bootstrap-size, and JSON checks; Node/npm remain unavailable for a full JavaScript parser or VS Code extension-host test.
- Keep the extension desktop-only and do not bring over the source repository's `src/lvl` or `Level.hx` level editor.
